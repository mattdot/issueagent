# Issue Agent

An AI-powered GitHub Action that analyzes, evaluates, and refactors GitHub issues into high-quality user stories. Transforms vague bug reports and feature requests into actionable, well-structured issues with consistent formatting, clear acceptance criteria, and proper context.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages Microsoft Agent Framework to understand issue intent and context
- ‚ú® **Automatic Enhancement**: Converts rough ideas into structured user stories with acceptance criteria
- üè¢ **Enterprise Ready**: Supports GitHub Enterprise Server via custom API endpoints
- ‚ö° **Fast Startup**: < 1 second cold start with .NET 8 AOT compilation
- üîí **Secure**: Minimal permissions required (`issues: write`)
- üìä **Observable**: Structured logging with performance metrics and AI reasoning traces

## What It Does

Issue Agent automatically:

1. **Retrieves** full issue context (description, comments, labels, references)
2. **Analyzes** the content using AI to understand intent and requirements
3. **Evaluates** clarity, completeness, and actionability
4. **Refactors** (optional) into well-structured user stories with:
   - Clear problem statement
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical context
   - Related issues and dependencies
   - Suggested labels and milestones

## Quickstart

Add this workflow to your repository:

```yaml
name: Issue Context
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  analyze-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: read
    steps:
      - name: Retrieve Issue Context
        uses: mattdot/issueagent@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

## Configuration

### Inputs

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `github_token` | No | `${{ github.token }}` | Token for GitHub API authentication with `issues:read` permission. |
| `azure_ai_foundry_endpoint` | No | - | Azure AI Foundry project endpoint URL (format: `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>`). Falls back to `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` environment variable. |
| `azure_ai_foundry_api_key` | No | - | Azure AI Foundry API key for authentication. Falls back to `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_KEY` environment variable. Store in GitHub Secrets. |
| `azure_ai_foundry_model_deployment` | No | `gpt-5-mini` | Model deployment name in Azure AI Foundry project. Falls back to `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable. |
| `azure_ai_foundry_api_version` | No | `2025-04-01-preview` | Azure AI Foundry API version. Falls back to `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_VERSION` environment variable. |
| `enable_verbose_logging` | No | `false` | Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting. When enabled, logs detailed information about configuration, connections, and authentication at the Debug level. |

### Azure AI Foundry Configuration

Issue Agent uses Azure AI Foundry for AI-powered issue analysis. To enable AI features:

#### 1. Create Azure AI Foundry Project

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com)
2. Create a new project or use an existing one
3. Note the project endpoint URL (Settings ‚Üí Overview)
4. Generate an API key (Settings ‚Üí Keys and Endpoints)

#### 2. Add Secrets to GitHub

Add these secrets to your repository (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions):

- `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`: Your project endpoint URL
- `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_KEY`: Your API key

#### 3. Update Workflow

```yaml
name: Issue Context
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]

jobs:
  analyze-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: read
    steps:
      - name: Analyze Issue
        uses: mattdot/issueagent@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
          azure_ai_foundry_endpoint: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT }}
          azure_ai_foundry_api_key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_KEY }}
          azure_ai_foundry_model_deployment: gpt-4o-mini  # Optional: specify your model
```

#### How Environment Variables Work

The action passes inputs to the Docker container as environment variables. You have two options:

**Option 1: Use inputs (recommended)**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Analyze Issue
    uses: mattdot/issueagent@v1
    with:
      github_token: ${{ github.token }}
      azure_ai_foundry_endpoint: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT }}
      azure_ai_foundry_api_key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_KEY }}
```

**Option 2: Mix inputs and environment variables**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Analyze Issue
    uses: mattdot/issueagent@v1
    with:
      github_token: ${{ github.token }}
      # Inputs take precedence; if not provided, falls back to env vars
      azure_ai_foundry_endpoint: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT }}
```

The action internally checks inputs first, then falls back to `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_*` environment variables if inputs are not provided.

#### Connection Validation

The action validates the Azure AI Foundry connection during startup:
- Validates endpoint URL format
- Checks API key length (minimum 32 characters)
- Establishes connection within 30 seconds
- Logs connection success with duration metrics

Failed connections will cause the action to fail with a descriptive error message.

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Verbose Logging

If you're experiencing issues with the action (such as authentication failures or connection problems), enable verbose logging to get detailed diagnostic information:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Analyze Issue
    uses: mattdot/issueagent@v1
    with:
      github_token: ${{ github.token }}
      azure_ai_foundry_endpoint: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT }}
      azure_ai_foundry_api_key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_API_KEY }}
      enable_verbose_logging: true
```

When verbose logging is enabled, the action will output:
- Configuration loading details (which environment variables are set)
- Azure AI Foundry connection attempts and responses
- Authentication provider initialization
- API request/response status codes
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

**Security Note**: Verbose logs do NOT contain API keys or tokens - these are always redacted for security.

### Common Issues

**Authentication Error (401)**:
- Verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Check that the API key has access to the specified endpoint
- Ensure the endpoint URL is correct (format: `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>`)

**Connection Timeout**:
- Check network connectivity to Azure AI Foundry
- Verify the endpoint URL is accessible from GitHub Actions runners
- Consider firewall or proxy settings in your organization

**Model Not Found (404)**:
- Verify the model deployment name matches your Azure AI Foundry configuration
- Check that the model is deployed and available in your project

## Current Status & Roadmap

**‚úÖ Currently Implemented:**
- Core issue context retrieval via GitHub GraphQL API
- Fast, AOT-compiled Docker action
- GitHub Enterprise Server support
- Comprehensive test suite (24 tests including Docker integration)

**üöß In Development:**
- Microsoft Agent Framework integration
- AI-powered analysis and evaluation
- Issue enhancement and refactoring
- Quality scoring system

**üìã Planned Features:**
- Support for custom issue templates
- Multi-language issue analysis
- Configurable AI prompts and templates
- Epic and milestone suggestions
- Code context integration (analyze referenced files)
- Team-specific conventions and formatting

## Performance

Optimized for GitHub Actions environments:

- **Cold Start**: < 1 second (AOT compilation)
- **Issue Retrieval**: < 2 seconds
- **AI Analysis**: 2-5 seconds (when implemented)
- **Total Execution**: < 10 seconds (typical)
- **Binary Size**: ~15MB (AOT-compiled, trimmed)

Performance metrics are logged including startup time and (future) AI reasoning time.

## Privacy & Security

- **Data Handling**: Issue content is sent to configured AI endpoint (Azure OpenAI or OpenAI)
- **Token Security**: GitHub tokens are redacted from all logs
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requires `issues:read` for evaluation, `issues:write` for updates
- **Enterprise Deployment**: Can be fully air-gapped with Azure OpenAI in your tenant
