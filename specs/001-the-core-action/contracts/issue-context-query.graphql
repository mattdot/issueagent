# GraphQL Contract — Issue Context Query
# Purpose: Retrieve the issue and recent comments that triggered the workflow event.
# Variables are populated using GitHub-provided environment variables and event payload fields.

# Expected variable bindings (resolved within the action runtime):
# owner → ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY%/*}
# name → ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY#*/}
# issueNumber → Derived from event payload (issue.number)
# commentsPageSize → Constant 5 (configurable via future inputs)
