# Feature Specification: AI Foundry Connectivity

**Feature Branch**: `002-ai-foundry-connectivity`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AI Foundry Connectivity. add connectivity to Azure AI Foundry. The action needs to take connection information for AI Foundry project / endpoint / api version / keys / whatever is needed. Remember that the agent uses the Microsoft Agent Framework https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework we should start with key based authentication, but design should be extensible to support service principal auth without refactoring what we add now"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: When the Azure AI Foundry connection fails during action startup (network timeout, service unavailable), should the action implement retry logic? → A: Fail immediately without retries (fail-fast only)
- Q: What timeout value should the action use when attempting to establish the initial connection to Azure AI Foundry? → A: 30 seconds (standard web request timeout)
- Q: Should the action log Azure AI Foundry API request/response details (model invocations, token usage, response times) for observability and debugging? → A: No logging of API interactions (only connection events). OpenTelemetry support planned for future.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a GitHub Actions workflow maintainer, I want to configure the IssueAgent action to connect to Azure AI Foundry so that the agent can use AI models hosted in my Azure AI Foundry project to analyze and respond to GitHub issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub Actions workflow using IssueAgent, **When** I provide Azure AI Foundry endpoint and API key as action inputs, **Then** the agent successfully connects to Azure AI Foundry and can process issue context.

2. **Given** a configured IssueAgent with valid Azure AI Foundry credentials, **When** the action runs on an issue event, **Then** the agent invokes the AI model through Azure AI Foundry to generate responses.

3. **Given** an IssueAgent configured with invalid Azure AI Foundry credentials, **When** the action attempts to connect, **Then** the action fails with a clear error message indicating authentication failure without exposing sensitive credential information.

4. **Given** an IssueAgent configured with Azure AI Foundry connection parameters, **When** different authentication methods become available in the future, **Then** the configuration can be extended to support new authentication methods without breaking existing workflows.

### Edge Cases
All edge cases result in the action failing with a descriptive error message that explains the issue and provides actionable guidance for resolution:

- **When** the Azure AI Foundry endpoint is unreachable or returns network errors, **Then** the action fails with an error describing the connectivity issue and suggesting verification of the endpoint URL and network connectivity.
- **When** the API key is expired or invalid, **Then** the action fails with an error indicating authentication failure and suggesting credential rotation or verification.
- **When** the specified model deployment doesn't exist in the Azure AI Foundry project, **Then** the action fails with an error listing the deployment name that couldn't be found and suggesting verification of the deployment name in the Azure AI Foundry portal.
- **When** Azure AI Foundry service quotas are exceeded, **Then** the action fails with an error indicating rate limiting or quota exhaustion and suggesting retry after a delay or quota increase.
- **When** the API version specified is deprecated or unsupported, **Then** the action fails with an error indicating the API version issue and suggesting upgrade to a supported version.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The action MUST accept an Azure AI Foundry project endpoint URL as a configuration input
- **FR-002**: The action MUST accept an Azure AI Foundry API key as a secure configuration input
- **FR-003**: The action MUST accept an API version identifier as a configuration input with a sensible default value
- **FR-004**: The action MUST accept a model deployment name as a configuration input
- **FR-005**: The action MUST establish authenticated connections to Azure AI Foundry using the provided credentials
- **FR-006**: The action MUST validate that all required Azure AI Foundry connection parameters are provided before attempting connection
- **FR-007**: The action MUST handle authentication failures gracefully and report clear error messages
- **FR-008**: The action MUST support configuration through GitHub Actions input parameters
- **FR-009**: The action MUST support configuration through environment variables as an alternative to direct inputs
- **FR-010**: The action MUST allow Azure AI Foundry credentials to be stored as GitHub secrets and passed securely
- **FR-011**: The system MUST be designed to allow future addition of alternative authentication methods (e.g., service principal, managed identity) without requiring changes to existing configuration inputs
- **FR-012**: The action MUST use the Microsoft Agent Framework for all interactions with Azure AI Foundry
- **FR-013**: The action MUST verify connectivity to Azure AI Foundry during startup and fail fast if connection cannot be established without implementing retry logic
- **FR-014**: The action MUST use a 30-second timeout when establishing the initial connection to Azure AI Foundry
- **FR-015**: The action MUST log connection attempts and outcomes for troubleshooting purposes while redacting sensitive credentials
- **FR-016**: The action MUST NOT log Azure AI Foundry API request/response details in the initial release (observability via OpenTelemetry planned for future enhancement)

### Key Entities
- **Azure AI Foundry Connection**: Represents the configuration required to connect to an Azure AI Foundry project, including endpoint URL, authentication credentials, API version, and model deployment identifier
- **Authentication Credential**: Represents authentication information (initially API key, extensible to other methods) used to authenticate with Azure AI Foundry services
- **Model Deployment Reference**: Identifies the specific AI model deployment within the Azure AI Foundry project that the agent will use

## Constitutional Alignment

- **Security-First GitHub Operations**: API keys and other credentials are provided exclusively through GitHub Actions secrets and never hardcoded or logged in plaintext. All authentication-related logging redacts sensitive information. The configuration design anticipates future support for more secure authentication methods like service principals and managed identities without requiring breaking changes.

- **Minimum Viable Delivery**: Initial release supports API key-based authentication only. Success metric: IssueAgent successfully connects to Azure AI Foundry and completes at least one issue analysis workflow using API key authentication in a test repository.

- **Performance-Ready Execution**: Connection to Azure AI Foundry is established once during action startup to minimize overhead. Connection validation occurs before processing begins to avoid wasted processing time. Authentication configuration is designed to support future credential caching strategies.

- **Human-Centered Agent Experience**: Configuration errors provide clear, actionable guidance for workflow maintainers (e.g., "Azure AI Foundry endpoint is required. Please provide 'azure_foundry_endpoint' input or set AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT environment variable"). Success and failure states are clearly communicated in action output logs.

- **Customizable Extensibility**: All Azure AI Foundry connection parameters are exposed as configurable inputs with sensible defaults where applicable (e.g., API version). Configuration schema is designed with forward compatibility in mind, allowing new authentication methods to be added alongside existing ones. Future authentication types can be selected through a new optional input parameter without breaking existing workflows using API keys.

- **C#/.NET + Microsoft Agent Framework Mandate**: All Azure AI Foundry integration is implemented using the Microsoft Agent Framework SDK for .NET 8.0. The solution uses the same authentication and connection patterns demonstrated in the Agent Framework's Azure AI Foundry samples, ensuring compatibility and alignment with framework best practices.
